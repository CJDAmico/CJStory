Billy and Bobby were walking down the street one day when the most amazing thing happened.
They were transported to the 692nd dimmension.
Obviously our human brains are incapable of comprehending what they saw, but they experienced the craziest things.
The 692nd dimension is a strange place, however it doesn't differ too much from the one that we live in.
In fact, everything is exactly the same, except every single person suffers from severe dementia, and nobody can remember anything about themselves.
Billy found a lot of “himself” next to him. It must have been the interlacing of the timeline, he thought. The strange thing is that each one plays a different role, including the police officer, the thief, the teacher, and so on. It's interesting, but in the end none of it actually mattered. It turned out that they weren't ACTUALLY transported to the 692nd dimension, they had just smoked some especially potent toad venom. 
After returning to a stable state of consciousness, Billy thought "wow that was pretty effing nuts." 
Bobby did not return to the same state of consciousness and Billy. Billy took Bobby to the hospital where he lay for 3 more years before finally being able to discern reality from the land he had experienced. Billy and Bobby would go on to become DARE representatives and share their story with at risk youth.
