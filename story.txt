Billy and Bobby were walking down the street one day when the most amazing thing happened.
They were transported to the 692nd dimmension.
Obviously our human brains are incapable of comprehending what they saw, but they experienced the craziest things.
The 692nd dimension is a strange place, however it doesn't differ too much from the one that we live in.
In fact, everything is exactly the same, except every single person suffers from severe dementia, and nobody can remember anything about themselves.
